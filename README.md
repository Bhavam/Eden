# Eden
Simulated agent environment using MLAgents architecture.

The Eden Academy Script trains multiple parallel iterations of an environment where AdamAgent finds apple for EveAgent and obtains 
rewards.

The trained neural net is continuously called on by each agent to find quickest search optimisation.
